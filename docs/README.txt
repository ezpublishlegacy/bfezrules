Purpose: to add the ability to process generic rule lists, producing a set of "actions" coming out of that.
You can also think about this as override that
1) can be applied anywhere
2) works with full Boolean logic
Practical applications possible: 

1) to determine/limit the child creation choices based on specific project needs. (see bfchildlimitation extension)
2a) to determine/limit block availability based on override-like rules (see bfextendedblock?)
2b) to determine/limit options used in blocks (see bfextendedblock?)

Multilanguage considerations:
None.

Multisite considerations (see below):
No problem.

Setup
=====
Just add as extension. 
In your code, call certain functions.

TBD more.
